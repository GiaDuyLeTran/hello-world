# hello-world
A beginning of an interesting journey

Hello everyone,
My name is Gia Duy and I'm a Mechatronics student at University of Technology in Vietnam (HCMUT-BKU).
I'd like to code in my free time and share the experience with other people.
Hope that I can learn from everyone here on GitHub.

Have a nice day.
